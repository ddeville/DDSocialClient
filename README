DDSocialClient is not maintained anymore. It was a fun project to work on at its time but things have changed quite a bit with all the new Social stuff on iOS.

======================

DDSocialNetworkClient is a handy library that makes access to social networking clients easy!

At the moment, it supports Facebook, Twitter, Flickr and LinkedIn.
I am planning to add support for Last.fm and Foursquare.

The authentication is based on OAuth.

Most of the server communication is done with the *excellent* ASIHTTPRequest library from Ben Copsey!
